# Project 1 Feedback



## Requirements:

You app, at a minimum must have the following requirements in order to achieve the base score.

1. Implement a location manager and use those coordinates in a visible-to-the-user way.
2. Implement the ability to add images (UIImageView) from the camera **and** photo library.
3. UI requirements
   1. UITableView with dynamic data
   2. Complex UIView (ex: MKMapView, UICollectionView, etc)



## Base Score

5/5 = 80%



## Extras

10 - `error: Build input file cannot be found: '.Trash/AppIcon.appiconset/Icon.png'` Failed to build, so I just deleted this file and it worked fine.

Looks good. May want a placeholder image since it first looked like the constraints were messed up until I added an image. Core Data implementation is a good start. Circular icon has dark corners.





# Final Score

80 + 10 = 90%
