## Base Score

7/7 = 80%



## Extras

20 - Lots of extra sketches, keywords look good. I like the logo but the checkmark seems a bit off center. The side menu is a good idea too. There are code libraries out there that'll make that simple to implement, since it's not a built in iOS feature.



# Final Score

80 + 20 = 100%
